NU CBC Homework #9 - Week #11 - Node.js Hangman App

## THE GAME CURRENTLY DOES NOT FUNCTION
I believe that the guessCheck function in word.js is causing the issue. 

This is a command line hangman game comprised of "bizarre" English words such as 
* *kerfuffle*
* *ragamuffin*
* *cattywampus*

To run the game, call the directory the repository is cloned to in your terminal.

Input "node index.js" to play.

Enter a letter when prompted to guess!

Good luck.
